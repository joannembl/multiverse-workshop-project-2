## Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Express.js
* RESTful Methodology
* MySQL

## Features
### CRUD and REST
* Read, add, delete, edit entries from the database
* Expect to do all of the above by accessing RESTful routes
* Be able to read specific entries
* Appropriately access the associated user info and other associated data

### Login, Hashing, Register
* Be able to log in to my API
* Any passwords saved to be hashed and salted
* Be able to sign up for the API
* Granted authorization to access the API on sign-up

### Authorization
* Private Routes protected from unauthorized users
* Helpful messaging indicating lack of authorization
* Not to be able to create new entities without first logging in / authenticating in some way (token/session)
* Data to only be accessible/editable/removable by associated user
* Have special super-user account type (admin) that allows access to content users don't have access to
* Admin should have full read/write access over all data

## Growth Goals
* Create frontend for Full Stack experience
* Continue to learn about hashing and authenticating
